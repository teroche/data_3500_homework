Programming Activity 1

 1. make a variable called apple_price (set it to whatever you want)
 2. make a variable called number_purchased (set it to whatever you want)
 3. make a variable called tax and set it equal to 1.07
 4. make a variable, total_bill and calculate it by: total_bill = apple_price * number_purchased * tax
 5. print clearly and cleanly how many apples were purchased and the total_bill
 6. add a check before the final print statement to see if total_bill is equal to 0.  If so, print a message to the user to check their inputs.
"""
apple_price = 1.25
number_purchased = 3
tax = 1.07
total_bill = apple_price * number_purchased * tax
if total_bill == 0:
    print("Please check your inputs. The total bill is 0.")
else:
 print(f"Number of apples purchased: {number_purchased}")
    print(f"Total bill (with tax): ${total_bill:.2f}")
